                 <h3>Data</h3>
                 <p>Data is a collection of a distinct small unit of information. It can be used in a variety of forms like text, numbers, media, bytes, etc. it can be stored in pieces of paper or electronic memory, etc.</p>
                 <h3>Database</h3>
                 <p>A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.</p>
                 <h3>Database Management System</h3>
                 <p>Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data.
                  It provides an interface between the data and the software application.
                 </p>
                 <h3>Why do we need DBMS?</h3>
                 <p><ul>
                   <li>Creation of database</li>
                   <li>Retreival of information from the database.</li>
                   <li>Updating the database.</li>
                   <li>Managing the database.</li>
                 </ul></p>

                   <li><b>DDL</b>
                  <p> Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database. </p></li>
                  <li><b>DCL</b>
                    <p>DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions and other controls of the database system. </p></li>
                    <li><b>DQL</b>
                      <p>Used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it. </p></li>
                      <li><b>DML</b>
                        <p>The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. </p></li>
                        <li><b>TCL</b>
                          <p>TCL commands deal with the transaction within the database.It includes commit, rollback,savepoint,set transaction </p></li>
